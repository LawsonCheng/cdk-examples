# CDK Examples
As projects I am working on require to deploy by using cdk. So that I would like to share how to create a cloudformation stack by using cdk.

## Examples
### fargate-with-custom-loadbalancer
Before run the cdk deployment, we need to prepare some resources from the AWS console.
1. Create an Application Load Balancer
2. Create an cluster with farget service type
